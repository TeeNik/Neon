Tactic turn-base shooter created on UE4.
I'm creating this game after my studies and part-time job as a game programmer. It's only for self-education and inproving my skills.
Some info:
Game is quite expandable because of its flexible entity component system that allows to easily add new abilities, enemies and interactive objects.
AI system with state-machine responsible for enemies' behaviour.
Several effects made with materials.
Future plans:
Add skill progressing system
Customize your abilities package before missions
